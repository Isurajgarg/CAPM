# CAPM

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

#### Introduction:
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a tool used in finance to estimate how much return an investment should provide, considering the level of risk involved. It was developed by William Sharpe in the 1960s and remains widely used today by investors and financial analysts.

#### Methodology:
CAPM figures out the expected return of an investment using a few factors:
- The risk-free rate $$(R_f)$$: This is the return you'd get if you invested in something with zero risk, like a government bond.
- Beta $$(\beta)$$: This measures how much an investment moves with the overall market. A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 means it's more volatile.
- Market risk premium $$(E(R_m) - R_f)$$: This is the extra return you expect to get from investing in the market compared to a risk-free investment.

#### Formula:
$$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \times (E(R_m) - R_f) $$

#### Why Use CAPM:
- **Easy to Understand**: CAPM provides a simple way to estimate expected returns based on market risk.
- **Widely Accepted**: It's a common tool used in finance for analyzing and comparing investment opportunities.
- **Helps in Decision Making**: CAPM helps investors make decisions about where to allocate their money based on the expected return compared to the risk.

### Fama-French 3-Factor Model

#### Introduction:
The Fama-French 3-factor model, developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, builds on CAPM by considering additional factors that influence investment returns. It adds two more factors - size and value - to provide a more comprehensive view of risk and return.

#### Methodology:
The Fama-French model calculates expected returns using three factors:
- Market risk premium $$(E(R_m) - R_f)$$: This measures the extra return you expect from investing in the market compared to a risk-free investment.
- Size premium (SMB): This reflects the tendency of small-cap stocks to outperform large-cap stocks over time.
- Value premium (HML): This accounts for the tendency of value stocks (those considered undervalued) to outperform growth stocks (those expected to grow quickly).

#### Formula:
$$ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{i,m} \times (E(R_m) - R_f) + \beta_{i,s} \times SMB + \beta_{i,v} \times HML $$

#### Why Use the Fama-French 3-Factor Model:
- **Better Explanation**: It offers a more detailed explanation of investment returns by considering additional factors beyond just market risk.
- **Real-World Observations**: The model aligns with what we see happening in the stock market, where small-cap and value stocks often perform differently from large-cap and growth stocks.
- **Improves Decision Making**: By providing a more complete picture of risk and return, the Fama-French model helps investors make better decisions about where to invest their money.

#### Main Differences:
1. **Factors Considered**: CAPM looks only at market risk, while the Fama-French model also considers size and value factors.
2. **Expected Return Calculation**: CAPM calculates expected returns based mainly on market risk, while the Fama-French model takes into account market risk as well as size and value premiums.
3. **Impact on Investment Decisions**: The Fama-French model provides more insights into potential returns, especially for small-cap and value stocks, compared to CAPM.

#### Difference in Expected Returns:
The difference in expected returns between CAPM and the Fama-French model comes from the additional factors considered in the latter. Because the Fama-French model accounts for size and value factors, it may predict higher expected returns for certain stocks compared to what CAPM would predict. This reflects the additional risks associated with those stocks, as captured by the Fama-French model.
